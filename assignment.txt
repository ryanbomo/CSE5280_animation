The sample video shows only two groups of pedestrians moving along the horizontal direction. Add two more groups that move vertically.

Your implementation should use the cost-minimization approach as described by Equations 3.1 and 3.2 in Breen's paper.

For each pedestrian,

    Calculate the overall cost of taking a step. This calculation is done locally around the pedestrian's current location
    Calculate the gradient (vector) of the cost
    Take a step towards the direction negative to the gradient. Display this direction as a "heading" vector for each pedestrian.
    Repeat steps 1 to 3 until the distance between the pedestrian and target location is "small enough".   

Submit your code to this canvas dropbox. Bring your laptop to demonstrate your animation in class (video demo). 

Locally, each pedestrian is taking the step that minimizes the cost function. The calculation is an instance of the optimization method called gradient descent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.). The gradient calculation and examples are given here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.).
